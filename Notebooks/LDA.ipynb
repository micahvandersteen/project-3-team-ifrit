    "# News headline topic analysis with Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to find dominant topics across news headlines (25 per day, over 1 year). These topics will later be correlated with daily stock market loss/gain information to understand how certain topics influence the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LDA?\n",
    "Latent Dirichlet allocation is a way to discover higher-level topics out of individual words present in any set of document (in our case, news headlines). You can use LDA to get a sense of the overall themes in a set of documents. \n",
    "\n",
    "LDA is an unsupervised machine learning model that works by analyzing two things: a distribution of topics in a document, and a distribution of words in a topic. The \"topics\" it finds aren't specific words (e.g., \"This headline is about 'war'\") but instead conceptually similar groups of words that together make up a theme (e.g., \"This headline is similar to the words 'war', 'crisis', 'iran'...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've created your LDA model, you can feed in a document and the model will score the overall relevancy of your document against the main _x_ topics found in your overall corpus. In other words, it will tell you which of the main topics found in the overall corpus are also found in your document, and to what extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why LDA?\n",
    "LDA is a fairly popular topic modelling choice among NLP professionals, and relatively straightforward to implement. Using LDA, we were able to find 10 dominant themes in eight years' worth of news headlines within about an hour—a task that would take a human days to analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does text pre-processing affect the accuracy of LDA?\n",
    "We tested two pre-processing approaches: Bag of Words and TF-IDF, each of which count how often words appear in a document. The TF-IDF model tries to understand which words are more important than others in a document, and scores them accordingly. The assumption was that TF-IDF preprocessing will help train a more accurate LDA model, but that did not turn out to be true; Bag of Words performed better.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does LDA perform compared to other topic models?\n",
    "LDA appears to perform more poorly than an NMF model on assigning topics to headline text, when topics are reviewed by humans. However, LDA topics perform _better_ in our regression analyses and neural network models, when used as features to predict stock market gains and losses.\n",
    "\n",
