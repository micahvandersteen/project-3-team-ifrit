    "# News headline topic analysis with Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) \n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this analysis is to find dominant topics across news headlines (25 per day, over 1 year). These topics will later be correlated with daily stock market loss/gain information to understand how certain topics may influence the stock market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is NMF?\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-negative Matrix Factorization is a mathematical technique that when applied to documents can take data with many features (e.g. 1000s of topics) and convert them into a smaller set of topics. It is similar to LDA in that it is a way to discover higher-level topics out of individual words present in any set of document (in our case, news headlines). You can use NMF to get a sense of the overall themes in a set of documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF is an unsupervised machine learning model that works by taking your matrix _A_ of documents x words (e.g. 50 documents and 5000 words) and returning topics (_W_) and weights/coefficients (_H_) for the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "As Rob Salgado explains in his [excellent article on NMF](https://towardsdatascience.com/topic-modeling-articles-with-nmf-8c6b2a227a45), \"NMF will modify the initial values of W and H so that the product approaches A until either the approximation error converges or the max iterations are reached.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "Like LDA, the \"topics\" that NMF finds aren't specific words (e.g., \"This headline is about 'war'\") but instead conceptually similar groups of words that together make up a theme (e.g., \"This headline is similar to the words 'war', 'crisis', 'iran'...\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've created your NMF model, you can feed in a document and the model will score the overall relevancy of your document against the main _x_ topics found in your overall corpus. In other words, it will tell you which of the main topics found in the overall corpus are also found in your document, and to what extent.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why NMF?\n",
    "\n",
    "NMF is regarded to be superior to LDA in terms of efficiency and accuracy, though it does not appear to be as popular. \n",
    "\n",
    "## How does NMF perform compared to LDA?\n",
    "NMF appears to generate more coherent and accurate topic groupings, but interestingly NMF-processed data did not perform as well as LDA data in our regression and RNN analyses.\n",
    "\n",
