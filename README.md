# Predicting the Stock Market?
This project examines the challenge of building machine learning models that can predict the rise and fall of the stock market based on what's in the news. For example, will stock prices rise with more positive 
news? Are there certain key phrases or words that impact the direction of market values? Are certain analytical approaches better for finding these relationships? Our analysis found that the stock 
market is as unpredictable as one might think.
